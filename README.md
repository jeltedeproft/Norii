Welcome!

Norii is a 2d turn based strategy game made with Java and LibGDX. I have been working on this on and off since September 2018. Due to a busy personal life I did not find the time to develop this enough and therefore I decided to go open-source, hoping that this will reignite the development.


Norii is fully [open source](https://github.com/jeltedeproft/Norii) and licensed [Apache 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

We encourage contributions from anybody and try to keep a warm and friendly community and maintain a [code of conduct](https://github.com/jeltedeproft/Norii/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)


## Playing

Norii requires Java 8 - [download it here](https://www.java.com/en/download/). Also make sure that your graphics card driver is up to date.

In order to play the game, simply fork and clone the repo and then run the desktoplauncher.java file. (I personally used Eclipse, I haven't yet tested for other IDE's)


## Developing

WIP, I dont have a formalized way of creatting issues yet.
